### Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

This repo contains my work for Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" course.

It is a fantastic series of lectures and exercises that dives deep into the fundamentals of neural nets and deep learning in a very hands-on, first-principles way. For example, in the very first lecture, we implement backpropagation from scratch without using any libraries (no pytorch, numpy, etc).

I highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to acquire foundational skills for building and training neural networks.
